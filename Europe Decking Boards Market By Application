In the residential sector, decking boards are extensively used in outdoor spaces such as patios, terraces, and garden pathways. Homeowners seek decking solutions that offer durability, aesthetic appeal, and low maintenance. As preferences shift towards eco-friendly and sustainable materials, composite decking boards, which blend wood fibers with plastic, are gaining traction.

The choice of material often depends on the climatic conditions of the region and personal preferences regarding maintenance and appearance.</p><p>In the commercial sector, decking boards find applications in public spaces, including parks, boardwalks, and commercial buildings. These environments require decking solutions that can withstand high foot traffic and varying weather conditions. As such, durability and resistance to wear and tear are critical factors.
