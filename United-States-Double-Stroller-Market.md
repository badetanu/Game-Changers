Double strollers in this category are designed with comfort, safety, and versatility in mind, often featuring fully reclining seats, adjustable canopies, and secure harness systems. These strollers are particularly popular among parents of twins or those with children of close age proximity. The design typically includes bassinet-style seating or adjustable recline positions that allow infants to lie flat, which is important for spinal development in the early months. The importance of safety features such as stability, braking systems, and durable construction is emphasized in this segment, as parents seek peace of mind while navigating busy environments like parks or shopping malls. In addition to safety and comfort, this segment also benefits from increasing innovation in stroller designs, with lightweight frames and easy folding mechanisms becoming a priority. The under 1-year-old category is often associated with high-end, multifunctional strollers that not only serve as transportation but also as a space for napping or calming the child. Furthermore, strollers in this category are commonly seen with features like adjustable footrests, extended sunshades, and ample storage space to accommodate the needs of parents traveling with babies. As more families prefer products that offer both style and functionality, the demand for these types of double strollers has been growing steadily in the U.S. market.<h2>1 to 2.5 Years Old</h2><p>The "1 to 2.5 Years Old" segment represents the transition period when infants begin to explore their environment more actively, requiring strollers that provide more interaction, mobility, and comfort. Double strollers for this age group are generally designed with two seats that are adjustable to cater to toddlers' growing needs. This segment sees a shift from bassinet-style seating to more upright, toddler-friendly configurations. Features such as cup holders, snack trays, and maneuverability are essential in this category, as parents look for strollers that allow for easier navigation through busy streets or parks while keeping their children entertained. Additionally, comfort and durability are paramount, with more cushioned seating, secure harness systems, and extended footrests to accommodate the development of toddlers who may be more active and restless.The demand for strollers in this age range is also influenced by the increasing trend of active families who prioritize mobility and convenience. Strollers in this segment are typically lightweight but robust, enabling parents to easily transport them in and out of vehicles. Moreover, the design often includes features like adjustable handlebars for parents’ comfort, especially since children in this age group might still require naps while on the go. The integration of parent-facing and forward-facing configurations provides flexibility, allowing toddlers to either interact with their caregivers or observe the world around them. As more parents look for products that support their child’s active lifestyle and offer both comfort and functionality, this segment is experiencing a steady growth trajectory.<h2>Above 2.5 Years Old</h2><p>The "Above 2.5 Years Old" segment caters to older toddlers and young children who have outgrown the traditional baby stroller but still require a form of transportation that offers both safety and comfort. In this segment, double strollers are often designed for children who are more mobile, which influences the design to accommodate for longer distances, higher seating positions, and greater comfort. These strollers typically offer more durable and spacious seats, as well as adjustable features to cater to the child’s growth. While children in this age group are more likely to walk on their own, parents often prefer double strollers for convenience, especially when traveling with multiple children or managing different schedules. Features such as large canopies for sun protection, enhanced suspension for a smoother ride, and ample storage space for belongings are common in this segment.In this category, the strollers are usually equipped with larger wheels and better suspension systems to handle different terrains, making them suitable for longer walks or outings.

The "Above 2.5 Years Old" segment is ideal for parents who need a stroller to manage multiple children of varying ages, where flexibility and long-term use become essential factors.
